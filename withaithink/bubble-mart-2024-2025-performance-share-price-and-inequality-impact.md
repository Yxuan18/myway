# Bubble Mart 2024–2025: Performance, Share Price, and Inequality Impact

> Bubble Mart (POP MART, 09992.HK) is a leading Chinese “trendy toy” company known for collectible blind-box figurines. In recent years it has evolved beyond being just a **“blind box”** retailer – for example, it launched standalone concept stores for its popular characters (like the Hirono brand store pictured in Shanghai) and expanded into new product lines. This answer examines Bubble Mart’s **financial performance** and **share price trends** over 2024–2025, and analyzes how changes in China’s **income inequality** (Gini coefficient) and consumer behavior (**“consumption downgrading”** vs **“upgrading”**) might be influencing the company’s fortunes. The findings also highlight **investment implications** for Bubble Mart given these dynamics.

### Bubble Mart’s Recent Financial Performance (2024–2025)

Bubble Mart delivered strong growth in 2023 and **explosive** results in 2024, reflecting successful expansion of its product portfolio and customer base. Key financial highlights include:

* **FY 2023:** Revenue reached **RMB 6.30 billion**, a year-on-year increase of 36.5%, with adjusted net profit **RMB 1.19 billion** (up 107.6% YoY)​[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/35342893/bubble-mart-handed-over-the-most-beautiful-financial-report-in). Despite pandemic-era challenges, the company achieved robust domestic growth (\~25% in China) and rapidly growing global sales​[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/35342893/bubble-mart-handed-over-the-most-beautiful-financial-report-in).
* **FY 2024:** Revenue **more than doubled** to **RMB 13.04 billion**, a **+106.9%** YoY jump​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/). Net profit surged to about **RMB 3.3–3.4 billion**, nearly **triple** the prior year (≈185–204% increase)​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682). This stellar performance was driven by broad-based strength across Bubble Mart’s collectible **IP portfolio** – the company boasted 13 different character IPs each exceeding RMB 100 million in annual revenue​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682). Notably, the “_THE MONSTERS_” series (featuring the popular **LABUBU** character) grew sales by **726%** in 2024, becoming the top-grossing IP (over RMB 3.04 billion)​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682). Another newer IP “CRYBABY” jumped **1537%** to RMB 1.16 billion​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682). This indicates **extraordinary demand** for Bubble Mart’s hit characters.
* **Domestic vs Overseas:** While China remains the largest market, overseas expansion contributed significantly to growth. In 2024, China mainland revenue was about **RMB 7.97 billion** (+52.3% YoY) whereas **overseas revenue** skyrocketed **375%** to **RMB 5.07 billion**, making up nearly **39%** of total revenue​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/)​[m.thepaper.cn](https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30541196). Bubble Mart opened flagship stores in global locations (e.g. Paris’s Louvre, Vietnam’s Ba Na Hills) and by Q1 2025 operated 26 stores in the U.S., fueling international sales momentum​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/).
* **Early 2025 Momentum:** The rapid growth continued into 2025. In Q1 2025, Bubble Mart’s unaudited sales rose an estimated **165%–170% year-on-year**, with **China sales up \~95–100%** and **overseas sales up \~475%**&#x200B;[finance.sina.com.cn](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-04-22/doc-ineuafyn3873016.shtml). This reflects both post-pandemic domestic recovery and _explosive_ global traction. For instance, U.S. revenue in Q1 2025 exceeded its entire 2024 U.S. revenue (100%+ YoY growth)​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/). The company’s **gross profit margin** also climbed to a record 66.8% in 2024 (up 5.5 percentage points)​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/), indicating improved efficiency even as it scaled.

Overall, Bubble Mart’s financial performance in 2024 was **phenomenal**, setting record highs in revenue and profit. Management expressed confidence by initiating dividends and stock buybacks in 2023​[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/35342893/bubble-mart-handed-over-the-most-beautiful-financial-report-in). They have set ambitious targets for 2025 (aiming for RMB 20 billion revenue)​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/), banking on continued global expansion and strong fan engagement to sustain growth.

### Share Price Trends in the Past Year

Bubble Mart’s **share price** has mirrored its financial fortunes with dramatic volatility. Over the past 6–12 months, the stock experienced a **meteoric rise** followed by swings, ultimately reaching new highs by early 2025:

* After bottoming out in late 2022 amid broader market downturns, Bubble Mart’s stock embarked on a **massive rally** through 2023 and early 2024. From its 2024 low to the peak, the share price at one point had skyrocketed about **909%** in just over a year​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682). (From the October 2022 trough, the gain was an astounding \~1500%​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682).) This reflects the market’s enthusiastic re-rating of Bubble Mart as its earnings rebounded.
* **Record Highs:** In late March 2024, on the heels of the stellar 2024 earnings report, Bubble Mart’s Hong Kong–listed shares surged \~10% in a single day to a **record high**, pushing the company’s market cap above **HK$210 billion**​[m.thepaper.cn](https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30541196). By April 2024 the stock was trading around **HK$175–180** per share, a sharp contrast to roughly HK$20–30 levels a year prior.
* **Mid-2024 Volatility:** The stock’s steep climb was followed by volatility. Like many high-momentum stocks, Bubble Mart saw a correction as investors took profit and weighed valuation concerns. By late 2024, the share price had pulled back significantly from its spring highs (a 52-week low around HK$33 was recorded within the year)​[cn.investing.com](https://cn.investing.com/equities/pop-mart-international-group). This roller-coaster reflects changing sentiment – from euphoria to caution – as the initial “blind box” hype moderated.
* **Resurgence in 2025:** The beginning of 2025 brought another surge in investor optimism. Thanks to outstanding Q1 2025 sales growth, Bubble Mart’s stock nearly **doubled** in the first few months of 2025 alone​[finance.sina.com.cn](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-04-22/doc-ineuafyn3873016.shtml). As of April 2025, the share price hovers around **HK$190+** (with a 52-week range of roughly **HK$33 to HK$195**)​[cn.investing.com](https://cn.investing.com/equities/pop-mart-international-group). Year-to-date, the stock was up about **96%** by late April 2025​[finance.sina.com.cn](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-04-22/doc-ineuafyn3873016.shtml), again approaching all-time highs.

In summary, Bubble Mart’s share price has been **extraordinarily strong** but **volatile**. The rapid appreciation in early 2024 and early 2025 highlights investors’ excitement over its growth, while the intervening plunge underscores the market’s jitters about sustainability and valuation. At current levels, the stock is priced for significant growth, leaving little room for disappointment.

### China’s Gini Coefficient: Latest Inequality Trends

The **Gini coefficient** is a measure of income inequality (0 = perfect equality, 1 = maximal inequality). In China, the Gini coefficient has been **high by global standards**, reflecting a sizable gap between rich and poor. Notable trends in recent years:

* China’s Gini coefficient **peaked around 2008** at approximately **0.49**, then **declined** steadily through the early-to-mid 2010s as the government took measures to uplift incomes more broadly​[undp.org](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2024-03/china_in_numbers_2023-final.pdf). The metric hit a low of about **0.462** in 2015​[undp.org](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2024-03/china_in_numbers_2023-final.pdf).
* Since the mid-2010s, inequality has **edged up again** slightly. In 2022, China’s Gini coefficient rebounded to **0.467**​[undp.org](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2024-03/china_in_numbers_2023-final.pdf). The latest available estimates put it in the mid-0.46 to 0.47 range. For instance, one source reports the Gini index in 2023 at **46.5 points (0.465)**&#x200B;[statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250400/inequality-of-income-distribution-in-china-based-on-the-gini-index/), essentially unchanged from the late 2010s. This level is **higher** than the Asia-Pacific regional average (\~0.35)​[undp.org](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2024-03/china_in_numbers_2023-final.pdf), indicating significant income disparity.
* The persistence of a Gini around 0.46–0.47 suggests that despite China’s economic growth, the **income distribution remains very unequal**. Urban-rural divides and wealth concentration in top tiers contribute to this. (As context, China’s official Gini in 2019 was 0.465​[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_China), so inequality today is roughly on par with that level.)
* Policymakers have acknowledged this gap and promoted “**common prosperity**” initiatives to improve equity. However, structural factors (e.g. skill premiums, regional differences) have kept the Gini elevated. In 2023, the urban household income was on average **2.38** times rural income (down from over 3x a decade ago, but still a large gap)​[undp.org](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2024-03/china_in_numbers_2023-final.pdf). Recent economic strains (like the pandemic and property downturn) may have also impacted lower-income groups more, risking further inequality.

In short, China’s **income inequality remains high**. The Gini coefficient in 2024–2025 is roughly **0.46–0.47**, marking only a modest improvement from the highs of the 2000s. This backdrop provides important context for consumer behavior shifts such as **“consumption downgrade”** trends in China.

### Consumer “Downgrading” vs “Upgrading” and Bubble Mart

High inequality and economic pressures have led to mixed consumer trends in China – often described as **“consumption downgrading”** versus **“consumption upgrading.”** These trends can significantly influence companies like Bubble Mart, which sell discretionary lifestyle products:

* **Consumption Downgrading:** When income growth for the masses stagnates (or economic uncertainty rises), many consumers become more price-sensitive and cut back on non-essential spending. In China’s recent **“消费降级”** environment, young consumers increasingly prioritize **value** and **practicality**. Surveys indicate a growing ethos of **frugality** – people seek cheaper alternatives for food, entertainment, etc., and think twice about splurges​[socialbeta.com](https://socialbeta.com/article/110197). As one analysis noted, even the currently booming trend-toy market could face a structural downturn as **“rational”** spending habits take hold among Gen-Z, who now favor cost-effective choices​[socialbeta.com](https://socialbeta.com/article/110197). In such a scenario, pricey collectibles might be viewed as unnecessary, and some fans could reduce blind-box purchases to save money.
* **Consumption Upgrading:** On the other hand, China’s rising middle class and affluent segments continue to pursue higher-quality, personalized products – a trend termed **“消费升级.”** For these consumers, unique experiences and emotional satisfaction often trump price concerns. Bubble Mart’s core customers (often young urbanites) value the **“emotional value”** of its toys. Indeed, during recent tough times, many Chinese youth turned to small **“dopamine”** purchases to lift their mood – calling items like cute collectibles their “**spiritual ibuprofen**” for stress​[socialbeta.com](https://socialbeta.com/article/110197). This reflects an interesting paradox: _economic stress has coincided with a surge in demand for feel-good products_. A research report noted that under “economy under pressure, playfulness rises,” and industries providing emotional or entertainment value (like trendy toys) saw **rapid growth** in the past two years​[socialbeta.com](https://socialbeta.com/article/110197).
* **Bubble Mart’s Strategy – Upgrade or Downgrade?** Bubble Mart has largely positioned itself on the **“upgrading”** side of this spectrum. Rather than slashing prices, it pursued **premiumization**: introducing higher-end products and collaborations that command even **higher prices**​[21jingji.com](https://www.21jingji.com/article/20250102/herald/d2ae8d8dabe3b36a4e13210c20240956.html). For example, Bubble Mart released special-edition figures with advanced materials (ceramic finishes, resin, etc.) at **premium prices** – one figurine launched in late 2023 cost ¥499 (\~$70), higher than the usual ¥399 price​[21jingji.com](https://www.21jingji.com/article/20250102/herald/d2ae8d8dabe3b36a4e13210c20240956.html). Its **Mega Collection** figures cost up to ¥5,999 each (for large 1000% scale collectibles)​[21jingji.com](https://www.21jingji.com/article/20250102/herald/d2ae8d8dabe3b36a4e13210c20240956.html). This “brand upgrade” approach targets devoted collectors willing to pay more for exclusivity. In contrast, some competitors embraced the **downgrade** trend – e.g. a rival toy brand **lowered its average selling price** from ¥89 in 2021 to ¥19 by 1H 2024 and even launched ¥9.9 mini toys to attract budget-conscious buyers​[21jingji.com](https://www.21jingji.com/article/20250102/herald/d2ae8d8dabe3b36a4e13210c20240956.html). Bubble Mart, however, leveraged its strong IP appeal to **raise ASP (average selling price)** without alienating its fanbase.
* **Effect on Performance:** So far, Bubble Mart has _defied_ the downgrading headwinds. Despite a broader environment of cautious spending, its 2024 results show Chinese consumers were willing to spend _more_ on its collectibles – domestic sales grew 52%, and popular IP lines experienced triple-digit growth​[thepaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30603682). This suggests that for a segment of consumers, Bubble Mart’s products are considered affordable luxuries or must-have hobby items. Anecdotally, avid fans claim _“when I feel bad, I buy a toy to comfort myself; when I feel good, I buy one to reward myself!”_ – illustrating how emotional drivers can override economic worries​[m.thepaper.cn](https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30541196). The company’s expanding member base (over 46 million registered mainland members by end of 2024)​[m.thepaper.cn](https://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30541196) also indicates it continues to attract new buyers even as some tighten their belts.

In summary, **income inequality’s impact on Bubble Mart is twofold**: On one hand, high inequality (and a slowing economy) pressures a broad swath of consumers to **downgrade** their spending, which could limit Bubble Mart’s growth among price-sensitive groups. On the other hand, the company has tapped into a passionate, more affluent (or at least indulgence-seeking) customer segment that continues to **upgrade** consumption by chasing artful, novel collectibles. This “small luxury” effect – where even in lean times, people treat themselves to small pleasures – has so far benefited Bubble Mart. However, it’s a delicate balance: if economic inequality worsens or the **“practical savings” mindset** deepens, Bubble Mart may eventually feel a drag on demand, especially for its lower-end blind box sales in smaller cities or among casual collectors.

### Investment Implications and Outlook

The intersection of **Bubble Mart’s boom** and **China’s inequality trends** carries important implications for investors:

* **Sustainability of Growth:** Bubble Mart’s recent performance has been _phenomenal_, but investors must ask whether such growth is sustainable in an environment where not all consumers are thriving. The company’s reliance on fan-driven discretionary spending is a **double-edged sword**. If economic conditions improve for the middle class (through wage growth or reduced inequality), Bubble Mart could gain a broader customer base – a bullish scenario. However, if **income gains concentrate** only among the already wealthy, Bubble Mart might face a limited pool of domestic customers who can fuel further growth. There is a risk of market **saturation** among core fans, especially as some might curb spending when the novelty wears off or personal finances tighten.
* **“Lipstick Effect” vs. Cutbacks:** Thus far, Bubble Mart has benefited from a kind of **“lipstick effect”** (small indulgences thriving in tough times). But it is unclear how long this can counteract macroeconomic gravity. Analysts caution that the trend toy craze, while hot now, could see a **structural slowdown** if consumers collectively pull back on non-essentials​[socialbeta.com](https://socialbeta.com/article/110197). This would likely temper Bubble Mart’s domestic sales growth in coming years, moderating the lofty expectations embedded in its stock price.
* **Valuation and Market Sentiment:** The stock’s huge rally has made it **pricey** relative to current earnings (2024 P/E was in the 70s). In fact, despite 2024’s blowout results, some market indicators turned cautious. By early 2025, technical analysis rated Bubble Mart a “Sell” due to the **rapid price run-up** (≈75%+ YTD at one point) and a rich **market cap** (\~HK$240 billion)​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/). This dichotomy – stellar fundamentals vs. valuation concerns – underscores the risk of a **bubble-like scenario** if growth even slightly disappoints. Investors are wary of the stock’s high valuation **relative to sustainable growth**​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/), as well as potential over-reliance on hit products (e.g. the LABUBU plush craze accounted for a big chunk of 2024 growth). A **concentration of revenue** in a few trendy IPs or categories (plush toys were 22% of revenue after a 1289% jump in 2024) raises the question of faddish demand cycles​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/).
* **Macro and Inequality Factors:** Broader economic factors tied to inequality also play a role in investment outlook. If China’s **“common prosperity”** drive succeeds in raising incomes at the bottom, the resulting consumption uplift could benefit mass-market brands like Bubble Mart in the long term. Conversely, if youth unemployment remains high and income gaps widen, one could see reduced spending power among young adults – a key demographic for Bubble Mart. Additionally, **consumer psychology** can shift: after an initial phase of revenge spending and emotional splurges post-COVID, a more sober consumer attitude could emerge, tempering Bubble Mart’s sales growth. Investors should monitor indicators like household income growth, consumer confidence, and the Gini index trajectory as indirect signals of Bubble Mart’s addressable market health.

**Bottom Line:** Bubble Mart stands at the crossroads of powerful but opposing forces – **soaring corporate performance** and a domestic landscape of **uneven income growth**. The company’s stock has rewarded believers with tremendous gains, but going forward, its fate will be tied to how well it can continue appealing to consumers in an era of belt-tightening for many. The strong overseas expansion provides a cushion by diversifying revenue (reducing reliance on Chinese consumers alone)​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/), which is a positive for investors concerned about China’s inequality dampening local sales. Still, from an investment perspective, caution is warranted. Bubble Mart’s valuation already prices in rosy growth, so any sign of demand cooling – whether from a pop in the collectibles “bubble,” a shift in youth spending habits, or macroeconomic/inequality pressures – could lead to sharp corrections. Conversely, if the company navigates the **“downgrade vs upgrade”** divide skillfully (for example, by offering products at multiple price points or continuing to cultivate high-value IPs) and if income inequality stabilizes or improves, Bubble Mart could retain its status as a **growth juggernaut**.

In conclusion, **Bubble Mart’s 2024–2025 story** illustrates a successful company riding a wave of pop-culture and emotional consumption trends, even as many consumers face economic strain. Investors should keep one eye on the **financial numbers** – which are currently excellent – and the other on the **bigger picture** of consumer health and inequality. The interplay between these factors will determine whether Bubble Mart is a sustainable long-term winner or a short-term phenomenon vulnerable to the tides of China’s economic distribution. As of now, it remains a fascinating case where **strong earnings** and a **frothy stock** meet the reality of an uneven economy – a balance to be carefully watched​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/)​[ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/pop-mart-explosive-q1-growth-global-toy-empire-motion-2504/).
