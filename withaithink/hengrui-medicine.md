## **Hengrui Medicine: Short-Term Outlook and Fundamental Analysis**

### **Financial Performance and Growth**

Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine has demonstrated a strong rebound in financial performance after a challenging 2022. The company’s revenue declined in 2022 amid industry headwinds, but returned to growth in 2023 and surged in 2024[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245)[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245). Net profits have grown even faster than revenues, reflecting improving margins. Table 1 summarizes Hengrui’s recent annual financials:

_Table 1: Hengrui Medicine – Recent Annual Financial Performance._ **Sources:** Company reports and filings[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245)[longportapp.com](https://longportapp.com/en/topics/29778042).

In 2024, Hengrui achieved **record-high revenue and profit**, with revenue reaching **CNY 27.99 billion** (+22.6% YoY) and net income **CNY 6.34 billion** (+47% YoY)[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and). This growth was driven by a robust recovery in sales of innovative drugs and one-time licensing income (discussed below). Profitability improved markedly – net profit margin expanded to **23%** in 2024 from \~18–19% in the prior two years[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245). Gross margins are very high (85% in 2024) due to Hengrui’s focus on specialty/innovative drugs, especially oncology products which carry \~92% gross margin[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and).

Quarterly trends underscore continued momentum. In the first quarter of 2025, Hengrui’s revenue rose **20.1%** YoY to CNY 7.21 billion, and net profit jumped **37.2%** to CNY 1.88 billion[thebambooworks.com](https://thebambooworks.com/hengrui-pharma-surges-in-trading-debut-for-1-25-billion-ipo/). This indicates the company is sustaining double-digit growth into 2025, boding well for the 1–2 year outlook.

Notably, Hengrui’s financial turnaround follows a dip in 2022 when China’s healthcare reforms and COVID impacts pressured results. The company responded by doubling down on innovation and cost discipline. By 2023, revenue had stabilized with slight growth, and by 2024 performance accelerated sharply[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245)[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245). The **sales mix has shifted toward innovative drugs**, which exceeded 46% of revenue in 2024 (up from 38% in 2022)[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245). This helped lift margins, as innovative products are higher-margin and less subject to price cuts than older generic drugs.

Hengrui’s **R\&D investment** is a major contributor to its growth potential. The company consistently plows a large share of revenue back into research. In 2024, Hengrui’s R\&D expenditures reached **CNY 8.23 billion** (29.4% of revenue) – an all-time high[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and)[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245). This R\&D intensity (nearly one-third of sales) is significantly higher than industry norms. By comparison, global big pharma companies typically reinvest \~15–20% of sales in R\&D (Pfizer \~17.5% in 2024[students.tippie.uiowa.edu](https://students.tippie.uiowa.edu/sites/students.tippie.uiowa.edu/files/2025-04/s25_PFE.pdf), Roche \~20+%). Hengrui’s heavy R\&D spend did weigh on short-term profits in earlier years (net income dipped in 2021–2022), but it has begun to pay off in the form of an expanding innovative product portfolio and revived growth[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and)[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245).

Overall, **Hengrui’s financial health has improved markedly**. Revenue is on an uptrend and expected to continue growing at a solid pace (analysts project \~11% annual revenue growth over the next few years, in line with the broader China pharma industry[webull.com](https://www.webull.com/news/12566643459990528)). Profitability is rebounding as new high-margin drugs contribute more to sales. The company’s balance sheet is also strong – operational cash flow topped CNY 7.4 bn in 2024[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245), aided by upfront licensing payments, providing ample funds to support ongoing R\&D and expansion. This financial momentum and reinvestment capacity position Hengrui favorably for the next 1–2 years.

### **R\&D Pipeline Status and Key Drug Developments**

Hengrui’s short-term potential is underpinned by an extensive and advancing **R\&D pipeline**, with a focus on oncology and other innovative therapies. The company is one of China’s most R\&D-intensive pharma firms, and this is reflected in a **deep pipeline of new drugs** across multiple therapeutic areas.

**Pipeline Scale:** As of early 2025, Hengrui has more than **90 self-developed innovative products in clinical development**, with around **400 clinical trials** (including multiple global trials) ongoing[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). In 2024 alone, Hengrui obtained 112 new clinical trial approvals (INDs) for innovative drugs and moved **24 programs into Phase III**, **27 into Phase II**, and **26 new products into Phase I**xhby.net. Importantly, the company now has **16 marketing applications** (new drug applications or new indications) under review by China’s regulator (NMPA)[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). This robust pipeline cadence indicates a steady stream of potential approvals in the near term.

**Recent Approvals:** Hengrui’s innovation push has already yielded a growing portfolio of marketed novel drugs. By the end of 2024, the company had **19 Class-1 new molecular entity drugs approved in China**, plus 4 Class-2 (incremental innovation) drugs[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Over **10 new products were approved in 2024 alone**, including four first-in-class innovative drugs spanning neuroscience, autoimmune disease, and cardiovascular disease[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). For example, in 2024 Hengrui launched China’s first home-grown JAK1 inhibitor (for inflammatory conditions) and a new IL-17A monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). These new products are beginning to contribute revenue and diversify Hengrui’s portfolio beyond oncology.

**Key Pipeline Candidates:** Table 2 highlights several notable pipeline projects (especially in oncology) that are expected to drive Hengrui’s growth in the next 1–2 years:

| **Drug (Target/Category)**                   | **Indication / Therapy Area**             | **Status (as of 2025)**                                      | **Short-Term Outlook**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

These could enter global trials for obesity/diabetes. Short-term impact is licensing revenue (in 2024)[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html); long-term, potential royalties if successful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

These will broaden Hengrui’s portfolio in China in the immediate term. |

As shown above, **oncology is the centerpiece of Hengrui’s R\&D pipeline**. The company is China’s leading developer of anti-tumor drugs[thebambooworks.com](https://thebambooworks.com/hengrui-pharma-surges-in-trading-debut-for-1-25-billion-ipo/), with multiple cancer therapeutics either on the market or in late stages. Its PD-1 inhibitor _camrelizumab_ (brand name AiRuiKa) is already a key revenue driver in China’s immuno-oncology market. Hengrui has been attempting to enter the U.S. market with camrelizumab in combination with apatinib (a VEGFR inhibitor) for liver cancer. While the FDA has issued Complete Response Letters (CRLs) delaying approval (citing manufacturing and inspection issues)[fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-rejects-hengrui-elevars-pd-1-cancer-drug-combination-again)[fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-rejects-hengrui-elevars-pd-1-cancer-drug-combination-again), the partners (Hengrui and Elevar Therapeutics) are addressing these issues and remain hopeful for eventual approval[fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-rejects-hengrui-elevars-pd-1-cancer-drug-combination-again)[fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-rejects-hengrui-elevars-pd-1-cancer-drug-combination-again). Even if U.S. approval takes longer, domestic demand for camrelizumab (and new combo uses in China) will support its growth in the near term.

Beyond PD-1, Hengrui has a _rich oncology pipeline_ including novel biologics like **SHR-1701**, a bispecific fusion protein that simultaneously targets the PD-L1 checkpoint and TGF-β pathway. This drug has first-in-class potential globally (no approved similar therapy yet) and could reach the market in China by 2026 if Phase 3 results in gastric cancer are positive[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Hengrui is also investing in _ADC (antibody–drug conjugate)_ technology – the HER2-targeting ADC (SHR-A1811) is a particularly anticipated candidate that could become a **“breakthrough” treatment for HER2-positive cancers** beyond breast cancer, with an initial focus on lung cancer[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Additionally, Hengrui has small-molecule targeted therapies (e.g. famitinib, pyrotinib for HER2 breast cancer, etc.) and is exploring combination regimens to enhance efficacy of its immunotherapies.

In the **non-oncology arena**, Hengrui’s pipeline spans metabolic diseases, immunology, and more. A notable development was the 2024 out-licensing of its **GLP-1 analog portfolio** (for diabetes/obesity) to an international venture (Kailera Therapeutics), which brought upfront cash and will accelerate those candidates globally[firstwordpharma.com](https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5900198)[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-025-00002-8). Hengrui is also developing innovative drugs in neuroscience (one of the 2024 new approvals was in a neurology indication[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html)) and respiratory medicine (e.g. a new drug for dry eye and possibly asthma/allergy biologics in pipeline). This diversification means Hengrui is not solely reliant on oncology in the long run, although oncology will remain the primary growth driver in the short term.

**Regulatory and Clinical Milestones (Next 1–2 Years):** Hengrui’s management has guided that over **40 innovative products** could be approved in the **2025–2027** timeframe[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Specifically, \~11 new approvals are expected in 2025 and \~13 in 2026[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html)[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html), indicating a rapid expansion of the product portfolio. Many of these are new indications for existing drugs or China-first launches of novel drugs. For example, in 2025 the company anticipates approval of its **HER2 ADC (SHR-A1811)** and other products like **HR20013** (a novel dual-pathway antiemetic for chemotherapy patients) and **SHR8058 eye drops** for dry eye[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). By 2026, a potential approval of **SHR-1701** and other high-profile agents (like a **PD-1 + TKI combo** for cervical cancer, a new **EZH2 inhibitor** for lymphoma, etc.) are on the horizon[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Successful commercialization of these pipeline candidates will be critical for sustaining Hengrui’s growth momentum.

In summary, **Hengrui’s R\&D pipeline is robust and maturing**, with numerous late-stage assets in oncology and a growing number of innovative therapies in other fields. This pipeline strength supports a positive short-term outlook: investors can expect a cadence of new drug launches and indication expansions in the next 1–2 years, which should bolster revenue. The key factors to watch will be the approval timing and market uptake of major candidates (like the HER2-ADC and SHR-1701), as well as any progress in bringing Hengrui’s drugs to international markets via partnerships or trials (discussed next).

### **International Expansion and Partnerships**

Hengrui Medicine has been actively laying the groundwork for **international expansion**, although its overseas business is still in early stages. In the short term, the company’s global strategy is centered on **collaborations, licensing deals, and selective overseas product registrations** rather than immediate large-scale commercial presence. Here are the main aspects of Hengrui’s international progress:

* **Overseas Revenue:** Direct sales outside of China remain modest but are growing. In 2024, Hengrui’s **overseas revenue was CNY 0.716 billion** (about $100+ million), which is only \~2.5% of total sales but represented a +16% YoY increase[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and). The company has registered products in **40+ countries** (including some injectables, oral drugs, and anesthetics in Europe, the US, and Japan) and obtained over 20 overseas product approvals[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and). These are primarily generic or hospital-use drugs from Hengrui’s portfolio (for example, injectable oncology generics or supportive care drugs) that the company has introduced in emerging markets or through partners. While current overseas sales are small, Hengrui is steadily building an international footprint and regulatory experience.
* **Licensing & Partnerships:** A cornerstone of Hengrui’s global strategy is partnering its innovative compounds with international pharma companies. Since 2018, Hengrui has executed **13 out-licensing deals involving 16 novel molecules** with global partners[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Notable recent deals include:
  * **Merck KGaA (Germany)** – In 2024, Hengrui entered an exclusive licensing collaboration with Merck KGaA for two oncology assets (reported to be a PARP inhibitor and a Claudin 18.2 ADC). Hengrui received an upfront payment of **€160 million** and is eligible for substantial milestones[merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-enters-exclusive-license-agreement-for-hrs-5346-an-investigational-oral-lipoproteina-inhibitor-for-cardiovascular-disease-from-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-co-ltd/)[synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/article/what-are-jiangsu-hengrui-medicines-recent-drug-deals). This deal not only provided immediate high-margin revenue (licensing fees) which boosted 2024 profit, but also validates Hengrui’s R\&D on a global stage. Merck will carry forward development of these assets globally, potentially bringing Hengrui a share of future success.
  * **Kailera Therapeutics (USA)** – In 2024, Hengrui out-licensed its entire **GLP-1 agonist portfolio** (for metabolic diseases) to the U.S.-based startup Kailera. Terms included **$100 million upfront** (plus a $10 million near-term milestone) and a large total potential deal value over $6 billion in milestones[firstwordpharma.com](https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5900198)[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-025-00002-8). This was one of the largest cross-border deals by a Chinese pharma in the obesity/diabetes field, illustrating Hengrui’s ability to innovate beyond oncology. Kailera, backed by $400 million in funding, will develop these drugs in Western markets[biopharmadive.com](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/kailera-obesity-launch-ron-renaud-hercules-hengrui/728536/)[kailera.com](https://www.kailera.com/press-release/kailera-therapeutics-launches-with-400-million-series-a-financing/). For Hengrui, the deal brings significant non-dilutive funding and a stake in the global metabolic market if the drugs succeed.
  * **Merck & Co. (USA)** – Separately, in late 2023 Merck (MSD) struck a deal with Hengrui for a cardiovascular drug candidate (a Phase 2 **LPA inhibitor** for heart disease). Merck paid **$200 million upfront** for this molecule[biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/business/big-pharma-rushes-to-china-for-deal-prospecting-despite-regulatory-uncertainty). This adds to Hengrui’s list of blue-chip partners and shows its pipeline spans beyond oncology into cardiovascular innovation.
  * **Elevar Therapeutics / HLB (USA/Korea)** – Hengrui partnered its PD-1 drug _camrelizumab_ and the TKI _rivoceranib_ (apatinib) with U.S. biotech Elevar and South Korea’s HLB for development in **liver cancer**. Elevar has been leading the U.S. NDA filings (as mentioned, FDA approval is pending resolution of manufacturing issues)[fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-rejects-hengrui-elevars-pd-1-cancer-drug-combination-again)[fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-rejects-hengrui-elevars-pd-1-cancer-drug-combination-again). While not a traditional licensing (it’s a co-development arrangement), this collaboration is crucial for Hengrui’s first potential U.S. drug approval. It has already resulted in Hengrui’s camrelizumab being used in global trials (5,000+ patients across 50 trials globally so far)[elevartherapeutics.com](https://elevartherapeutics.com/2023/10/17/elevar-therapeutics-and-jiangsu-hengrui-pharma-announce-global-commercialization-licensing-agreement-for-pd-1-inhibitor-camrelizumab-in-combination-with-rivoceranib-for-uhcc/)[elevartherapeutics.com](https://elevartherapeutics.com/2024/09/23/elevar-therapeutics-resubmits-new-drug-application/).
  * **Others:** Hengrui has also licensed out drugs regionally (e.g. a **HER2 inhibitor pyrotinib** was licensed to Dr. Reddy’s for India[source.gbihealth.com.cn](https://source.gbihealth.com.cn/news/detail?id=2049245\&utm_source=official)) and formed JVs like Aiolos in 2023 (with VCs) to develop an asthma drug in the West[cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/china-biopharma-deals-rise-with-summit-merck.html). Since 2018, the total potential value of Hengrui’s out-license deals is significant (multi-billions), indicating a deliberate strategy to monetize its innovation globally.

These partnerships have **tangible short-term benefits**: in 2024, Hengrui recognized about **CNY 2.0+ billion** in licensing revenue (from the Merck and Kailera upfronts) which lifted its earnings[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). Licensing income was a major factor in the 47% profit jump in 2024, essentially becoming a “second growth engine” alongside domestic drug sales[xhby.net](https://www.xhby.net/content/s67f4f5d9e4b0af9e013c73f9.html). We can expect Hengrui to continue seeking such deals for other pipeline assets, which could further boost income in the next 1–2 years.

* **Building Global Presence:** Hengrui is reinvesting a large portion of its new Hong Kong IPO proceeds (75% of HK$9.75 bn raised) into R\&D, including global clinical trials and overseas R\&D centers[longportapp.com](https://longportapp.com/en/topics/29778042)[longportapp.com](https://longportapp.com/en/topics/29778042). It is also allocating funds to build or expand production and R\&D facilities **overseas** (around 15% of IPO proceeds) to support international launches in the future[longportapp.com](https://longportapp.com/en/topics/29778042). These moves indicate that Hengrui is preparing for a more direct global presence in the long run. In the near term, the **focus remains on regulatory approvals and market entries in key regions**. For example, Hengrui has obtained FDA Fast Track designations for 3 of its investigational drugs and an EMA orphan drug designation for one programxhby.net – a sign it is proactively engaging with Western regulators.

In summary, **Hengrui’s international expansion is progressing steadily via partnerships and selective product introductions abroad**. While the company’s overseas sales are currently small, its strategy of partnering with global pharma (Merck, etc.) provides non-negligible revenue and accelerates the global development of its drugs. In the next 1–2 years, investors should watch for milestones such as a potential FDA approval of camrelizumab (if manufacturing issues are resolved) and additional licensing deals on key pipeline assets. Hengrui’s management and analysts see international markets as a significant opportunity: Citi, for instance, forecasts Hengrui’s total revenue to grow \~21% CAGR through 2027 with increasing contribution from international businessaastocks.com. If Hengrui can convert a few of its pipeline successes into globally marketed drugs (either on its own or via partners), it would greatly enhance the company’s valuation and growth profile.

### **Competitive Positioning vs. Peers**

Hengrui Medicine is widely regarded as **China’s leading innovative pharmaceutical company**, and it competes with both domestic peers and global pharma giants. Below is a comparison of Hengrui’s key metrics with select peers – major Chinese pharma companies and global industry leaders – to gauge its competitive positioning (Table 3):

From the comparison, several points stand out about Hengrui’s competitive positioning:

* **Market Leadership in China:** Hengrui is the **most valuable pharmaceutical company in China** and is often cited as the bellwether for Chinese pharma innovation[thebambooworks.com](https://thebambooworks.com/hengrui-pharma-surges-in-trading-debut-for-1-25-billion-ipo/). Its revenue is on par with long-established domestic peers like Sino Biopharmaceutical, but Hengrui achieves a much higher net profit margin (over 20% vs low-teens for Sino) due to its focus on proprietary drugs and efficient operations[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245)[acnnewswire.com](https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/97226/sino-biopharm-\(1177.hk\)-announces-2024-annual-results). Hengrui’s aggressive R\&D spending (nearly 30% of sales) is roughly double the R\&D intensity of Sino Biopharm[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245)[acnnewswire.com](https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/97226/sino-biopharm-\(1177.hk\)-announces-2024-annual-results), highlighting Hengrui’s commitment to innovation. This has enabled Hengrui to build a pipeline and product portfolio that many domestic rivals cannot match in size or novelty.
* **Pipeline Strength:** Compared to other Chinese pharma companies, Hengrui’s pipeline is arguably the strongest. For instance, Innovent Biologics and BeiGene – two prominent Chinese biotech firms – each have a few blockbuster candidates (Innovent’s PD-1, BeiGene’s BTK inhibitor, etc.), but **Hengrui has a broader pipeline** with dozens of late-stage trials. In 2024, Hengrui had 8 NDAs under review and advanced 24 projects to Phase III[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/another-surge-chinas-innovative-drug-bull-market-begins-grize), far more than most local peers. This breadth gives Hengrui multiple “shots on goal” and reduces reliance on any single product. Moreover, Hengrui’s portfolio is diversifying (oncology plus metabolic, immunology, etc.), whereas many Chinese peers are concentrated in one area or heavily in generics. This pipeline strength has been recognized by independent analysts – for example, Frost & Sullivan ranked Hengrui among the top in China for innovative drug pipeline size and revenue from new drugs[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245)[news.futunn.com](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/56861226/jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-01276-plans-to-globally-issue-0-2245).
* **Valuation and Growth Expectations:** Hengrui’s stock commands a high valuation multiple (P/E \~45 trailing), reflecting investors’ growth expectations and confidence in its pipeline. This is significantly higher than global big pharmas like Pfizer (P/E in the low-teens) or even Roche (\~25) which have more stable, mature businesses. It’s also higher than some Chinese peers; for example, Sino Biopharm’s P/E (\~35) is elevated partly because its earnings are lower quality (smaller margin, some one-time gains)[acnnewswire.com](https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/97226/sino-biopharm-\(1177.hk\)-announces-2024-annual-results)[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1177.HK/). Hengrui’s premium valuation is underpinned by a projected growth rate (double-digit revenue CAGR) that exceeds most multinationals – whereas Pfizer and Roche are expected to have low single-digit growth (or even revenue declines short-term for Pfizer post-COVID), Hengrui is coming off a +23% revenue jump in 2024[moomoo.com](https://www.moomoo.com/news/post/51007631/in-2024-jiangsu-hengrui-pharmaceuticals-achieved-record-high-revenue-and) and is forecast to continue solid growth. Investors are essentially pricing Hengrui more like a high-growth biotech or early-stage pharma than a typical generics company.
* **Competitive Strategy:** Hengrui’s strategy contrasts with global pharma in its **market focus and innovation model**. Global giants like Pfizer and Roche have worldwide commercialization networks and invest heavily in both internal R\&D and external acquisitions. Hengrui, by contrast, has so far focused on dominating the domestic Chinese market and building internal R\&D capabilities, with selective partnering for global development. In China, Hengrui has a formidable commercial presence – a sales force of \~9,000 covering 22,000+ hospitals[longportapp.com](https://longportapp.com/en/topics/29778042) – which gives it strong reach for new product launches. Against domestic competitors, Hengrui’s scale and innovative brand image (often compared to a “Chinese Pfizer” in oncology) give it a competitive edge in winning hospital tenders for new drugs. Hengrui has also navigated China’s regulatory environment (e.g. volume-based procurement/VBP for generics) better by rapidly shifting its portfolio towards non-VBP innovative drugs, whereas some peers were hurt more by price cuts on generics.
* **Peer Pipeline and Market Strategy:** It’s worth noting that Chinese peers are also ramping up innovation – for example, **Sino Biopharm** recently launched a novel KRAS inhibitor and several biosimilars[acnnewswire.com](https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/97226/sino-biopharm-\(1177.hk\)-announces-2024-annual-results)[acnnewswire.com](https://www.acnnewswire.com/press-release/english/97226/sino-biopharm-\(1177.hk\)-announces-2024-annual-results), and **Innovent** achieved its first profit as its PD-1 and new products gain traction[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/another-surge-chinas-innovative-drug-bull-market-begins-grize). However, Hengrui’s pipeline depth (with multiple first-in-class prospects like SHR-1701) and its ability to consistently bring new drugs to market (10+ new approvals in 2024 alone) set it apart. Globally, compared to **Pfizer/Roche**, Hengrui is much smaller in absolute size but is growing faster. Pfizer and Roche each have dozens of pipeline projects as well, but Hengrui’s advantage is its focus on the high-growth Chinese market and lower development costs – it can run large clinical trials in China more cost-efficiently, and then leverage that data for global partnerships. In terms of **market strategy**, Hengrui is increasingly mirroring global pharma in innovation focus, but it differs in that it has _home court advantage_ in China’s huge market (1.4 billion population with rising healthcare spend) and it benefits from government policies encouraging domestic innovation. This gives Hengrui a strong foundation, which it can then extend abroad through the partnerships described earlier.

In conclusion, **Hengrui Medicine is competitively positioned as the leading innovator in China’s pharma industry and a fast-growing player on the world stage**. Its valuation and metrics reflect a company in transition from a domestic generics manufacturer to an international innovative pharma. Short-term (1–2 year) potential for Hengrui looks promising: the company’s financial performance is on an upswing, its R\&D pipeline is yielding new products at an accelerating pace, and its international forays (though nascent) are adding credibility and revenue streams. While it faces competition from both Chinese and foreign pharma peers, Hengrui’s combination of a rich pipeline, strong domestic platform, and increasing global integration suggests it is well positioned to deliver growth in the coming years. Investors should monitor execution on new product launches and the outcome of key pipeline events (approvals and partnership milestones) as the primary drivers of Hengrui’s short-term performance.
